404,"I had my interview scheduled with Amazon for 6 months internship (on-campus) and I didn't have any prior interview experience of any big company. I wanted to get real feel of the Amazon interview. Luckily I found Prankur sir who's already working at Amazon and came to know about his 1:1 sessions. Without a second thought, I booked Mock interview session. I can clearly say that it was really similar to the actual one and all the feedback given by Prankur sir at the end of the interview of my presentation style, I worked on and didn't repeat in the actual interview and thus it helped me in cracking the interview of Amazon. Thanks a lot Prankur sir for your sessions and feedback."
404,"The session was really helpful for me to understand how I should prepare myself for online assessment and onsite rounds at Amazon. You listed the DS and algo topics which I can use to ensure that I have covered all the topics. Then, you gave me some tips, such as - I should not focus on solving the problem only, rather I should focus on the approach to solve the problem. Regarding DP, one of your tips, such as - don't try to solve the dp problems with ""bottom to top"" approach is really valuable. Also, there were other tips on backtracking recursion. These are the tips that I might not get by googling. Also, your work experience in product-based company really inspired me to work hard for the interview. Although I have a very short time right now to prepare myself. So, if I don't get selected this time, I will definitely try Amazon or other product-based companies the the near future.  I am very thankful that you have given your valuable time & suggestion for preparing me for the interv"
404,"Hi Prankur bhaiya,

First of all, thank you for so much for taking out time for a 1:1 session with me. Before the session, I was very confused about the preparation strategy and list of topics to be covered. I was kind of stuck in the loop, where I was repeating the same things again and again.

But after the session, most of my doubts got resolved, you gave me an action plan to follow, you made me understand about the switch process in depth and what are the key things which needs to be done when someone wants to switch. 

I would really like to thank you for you valuable guidance. Keep doing the good work. It is really helpful for the folks who doesn't have proper guidance."
404,"The session provided a lot of clarity for me. It was a very useful session and was really helpful for my resume building and for my future job searches. Since it was a 1 to 1 session I was able to get plenty of my doubts clarified on an individual level. Overall the session was really awesome!"
404,"It was a very insightful session. I really liked the part where you first asked me how I am approaching problems and then you told me what I am doing wrong while approaching the problems. 
It was very helpful for me because before this I was solving problems but now I know how to find patterns and how to use those patterns to solve problems.

The whole session was very helpful for me and i will follow the points which were discussed in the session.
Thank you for your time and sharing your experience and knowledge"

I was kinda lost before I had the session with you, but after speaking with you, I feel like my path is set, your advice on how should I make notes for every new problem is something I would have never done if I hadn't spoken with you. I now have clarity on how to proceed with each topic in the most efficient and optimal way. The depth and breadth-first methods on how to proceed with topics were very insightful. Now I feel confident in my preparation journey.

1618,"Dear Sir

I attended a career counseling session with Pratik Sir on 4th February
2022. It was a much needed guidance. Pratik Sir was so humble and listened
to everything what I had to say. I'm from a non-technical background and
want to work as a content writer. But I was confused if I should target MBA
or other competitive examinations to land a secure job. After talking to
Sir and gaining perspective from an expert I feel more confident about my
decision. ""You should always have a plan B in your mind while going for
something so in case it does not turn out well you can keep going with the
other, Don't sit idle and keep following your passion"" were the words that
encouraged me to make this decision. I've decided to continue practising
aptitude and write blogs for starters.

Thank you so much for taking out the time to talk to students. Your
guidance really help us all.

Yours sincerely

"15159","Rose promised to offer me an advanced session on Personal Branding. But while balancing her personal & professional responsibilities, she couldn't proceed with it. 

As I play the role of a supportive younger sister, I didn't disturb her much. But when I noticed that she added a free booking option on her LinkedIn profile, I chose to avail of her service professionally. 

She was surprised by my booking. But this time, she chose to coach me for an hour instead of the 15 minutes she offer everyone. I haven't paid her. So maybe she will deduct it from my salary. 

Just because I'm her sister doesn't mean I shouldn't provide her with a 5-star review. She is the best & I'm proud of her, every single day.

"199","Sharing so that this helps others like me :) 

Taking up a job straight out of college was a daunting experience, and questions about when to go for masters and in which field kept circling back to me. (Mostly because of the location tags in my clg peers stories :)

But the 'why' behind masters was still hazy. ""Should I add another degree to my resume to adjust the visual balance? Is it the right step towards the future I want? Is this even the future I want?""

After looking at various courses and talking to people pursuing these degrees, I was still unsure of what I wanted to do. 

Today, after a genuinely helpful session on career guidance with Manan, I finally feel hopeful about having found the right pathway towards finding these answers for myself. And I'm truly grateful for the same :)

I would highly recommend these sessions to anyone who wants a wholesome and personalised perspective on discovering what you want in life and otherwise"

"265","So glad to have found such an informative session like this. I got so many insights on how to attend an interview which I have been doing blindly so far.
Few suggestions from my end:
1. The topic and time can be a little more organised. For eg., few topics you mentioned that you will get back later but due to time constraint you could not visit back.
2. Please add as many practical examles as possible only then the audience will understand better. Eg. When you told your personality has to reflect in your resume, Give real examples on how?
3. You can probably split the session to 2 days. That way you do not have to rush. Also the audience will get a day’s time to reflect over the topics covered and get back with questions by the next session.

Thanks again for the great initiative and helping so many job hunters."

In online world, its rare to find true people. And by luck  I found a true mentor.

Thank you for being so generous with your time this morning. I learned a lot from you.

As a senior leader, it is incredible how you openly admit that you see more failures but still trust your team members, delegate, coach, and build your team. Your encouragement to talk about the other person rather than yourself is your best quality that makes me feel like I've known you for years. Certainly, loved your connect.

You are an Awesome Coach and a Great leader !"

"13563","TBH it was okay okay. Felt like I was sitting in Sandeep Maheshwari session. The difference was that Vatsal is working at World Bank, unlike Sandeep who works from his home. So its Vatsal's resume which was justifying everything he was saying. He was at Yale, at SRCC, and probably from a good family background (Kolkata's Park Street). And that's the primary reason, people helped him. So he assumes that the World is not as bad as is talked about. If I change his college from Yale to some Indian Non-IIM/IIT institute, most probably his outlook wouldn't work to get to where is he right now."
"13563","I agree to what Mr Nahata stated that Networking is really the most needed for a person who has just completed his/her educational phase of life and is about to enter the working phase. Because apart from possessing good skills in his/her qualifications, there should be people around the corners who knows the same and requires the same and at a certain level acknowledges the same. And that is achieved only through Networking, either physical(when people speak up) or virtual(through emails or phone calls), speaking of which the latter(and also some of the physical part too) was greatfully advised onto us by sharing his personal experience and methods which led him to be successful. I found this webinar greatly informative and new and all the ideas shared by Mr Nahata were deeply satisfying."
